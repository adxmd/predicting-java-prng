Finding future outputs of pseudo-random number generator of Java's Random class given first two outputs

Information:

Assume we don't know the key (to find how the numbers are generated view javaCode.java)
Given the first two outputs of Random.nextInt():
 - n1: -745632980
 - n2: 2066963502

Find the next output of a call to Random.nextInt() and the seed used in the call to new Random(seed).
